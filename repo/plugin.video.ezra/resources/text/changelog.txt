[B]Roadmap / Git Requests[/B]

[B]Integrate Accounts into main Addon[/B]

[B]Premiumize Cloud - Search Folder Names[/B]

Currently the cloud search only checks file names not folder names. When downloading torrents that’s normally no issue because the folder name is same to the file name. But in the usenet world, nearly all file names are obfuscated to evade DMCD. But folder names are intact.change code, that first it’s does what it does now, and check file names, but if it hasn’t found anything then checks folder names

[B]Real Debrid API Keys[/B]

Implement option to use personal RD API key in My Accounts
